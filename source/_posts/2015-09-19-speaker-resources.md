Next week I will be presenting a "how to present" workshop at DrupalCon. I wanted somewhere to put the [resources from the talk](/speaker-training) and decided to resurrect this site. I've wrapped a bit more structure around some of the content on the site. I can now see some obvious places to add more resources. If you have things you would like to see covered on this site, please do open a [GitHub issue](http://github.com/emmajane/tito) and I'll do my best to fill in what you need to know.
