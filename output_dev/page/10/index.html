            <h1>Fishing and Eating Fish</h1>

<p>I’m reading The $100 Startup right now. I’m about 1/3 of the way into the book. I’m sure I’ll have more observations towards the end. But in the mean time, there’s one story that’s absolutely struck me. I’m totally guilty of doing it, which is part of what makes me love (and hate) the story so much.</p>

<p>It goes something like this:</p>

<p>You’re at a restaurant on a Friday evening. You’ve had a long week at work and you just want to relax with your friends and have a nice glass of wine. You order your meal (fresh lake trout) and about 10 minutes later the chef comes out from the kitchen and invites you back into the kitchen to help prepare the fish.</p>

<p>Normally you’d be very excited to get a cooking lesson. But that’s not what you’re here for. You’re here for the experience of the meal with your friends. You don’t want to learn how to cook fish tonight. You want to eat the fish and then go home. (And you definitely don’t want to do the dishes afterwards!)</p>

<p>Asking a client to participate in the process of your business can have the same unintentional side effect. You didn’t mean to make your customers uncomfortable. You were just really excited about teaching them how to cook. When I was working on the curriculum for the Drupal site building program last year, I ran into this problem. I sold instructions on how to build sites. But by the fifth site I started asking myself, “Why is this so hard?! Surely it shouldn’t take 100 pages of instructions to explain how to build this type of site?” Creating exceptional training products made me frustrated with the system I was trying to teach. It made me wonder:</p>

<p>No wonder people want to eat meatloaf!</p>

<p>The trainer’s job is to teach people to fish. It’s a delicate balance, but we also have a responsibility to inform the creators of the tools we teach where the pain points are for their tools. Spend a bit of time fixing the tools and you make it easier for people to eat fish dinner. On the flip side, I also think the trainer should take the time to step away from “How Things Are Done” to think about more efficient processes. In Drupal speak: why do we try to simplify the theme layer by adding very, very complex workarounds to it (template.php and preprocess functions)? Punting stuff into the theme seems like a holdover from the days when we competed with WordPress. Why not make module development more accessible and invite themers to use a more powerful toolkit? Why are we crippling them by implying that “modules are hard”?</p>

<p>Even if that last bit didn’t make a lot of sense to you, you probably got the gist of it: sometimes trainers uncover systematic problems with the toolmaker’s idea of “best practices”. Sometimes we need to step away from a community of tool creators and users and ask ourselves, “Is this really the best way to approach this problem? Am I forcing people to eat a fish dinner when they actually should be learning to fish for themselves?”</p>

            <h1>A New Funding Model for Curriculum</h1>

<p>I’m putting together the sales information for the new course that I’m writing with Lorna. We’ve opted for a new funding model for the workshop. It is very much based on the idea of a Kickstarter “prepaid” project. It is also very similar to the format I’ve used for one of my other workshops where I required a minimum number of registrants and agreed to give a free license to the content so that participants could reuse as much of the material as possible. From the sales page:</p>

<p>Seats in this course are being sold in a non-traditional manner. We like to think of the sales model as a kick-starter for curriculum. We are selling 25 group seats in the program. Each company that buys a seat may send as many attendees as they would like. The course will only run if a minimum of 10 seats are sold. If all 25 seats are sold the full curriculum, including teacher resources, will be released as GPL and made available for other training companies to deliver. Companies buying a seat in the program will be eligible to have their logo included in the course material and be recognized as a sponsor of the program.</p>

<p>Company seats are available for $1500USD. On registration, you will be contacted via email with an invoice. Seats are only confirmed when payment is received. First paid, first served. As there are only 25 spaces available, we encourage you to register early for this program.</p>

<p>The workshop site should be open by the end of the week. I’m looking forward to it, a lot!</p>

            <h1>Helping Your Audience Learn</h1>

<p>Jacinta (Perl Training Australia) has an excellent presentation on how to simplify the training experience for your learners. Some of my favourite tips include:</p>

<p>Reduce the extraneous cognitive load. Remove the stuff that gets in the way of learning the key lessons.
Be realistic about the amount of time you actually have in a class. 9-5PM is actually 6 hours when you factor in breaks and lunch and mental overload.
Don’t expect your students to learn too much in a single day. Confine your topics. Have tight tight chapter boundaries and very clear limits. A single “chapter” shouldn’t take more than 90 minutes.
Don’t waste time in the morning talking about yourself. Jump to the most important topics right away. Put the easy stuff at the end of the day when they’re overwhelmed and can absorb less information.
Full brains are like full stomachs. If you wait long enough, you’ll be able to eat more (or have dessert).
The very basic principles must be at the very beginning–even if it seems sequentially out of order. In the first half day, students are the freshest and will have the best chance of understanding concepts.
Optional materials go to the end of the course, when students are least able to learn (great visual slide explanation at 17:30).
Wouldn’t it be great if they also knew this and that and that and that? …put it in another course, make more money.
Group similar ideas in ways that make sense to you. Provide scaffolding showing people why you think the topics are related (e.g. mind maps or other visuals). Put important words in bold.
Jacinta uses 10:10. Ten minutes of talking, ten minutes for the students to play with an exercise. If a big practical exercise it can go as long as 10:20. But 10:30 is too much time for the students to be on their own.
In your introduction, limit yourself to 1-3 concepts (where possible). Students can get exercise fatigue though, so  you might need to group concepts. 23:15 has some math of how many concepts you can cover in a day. e.g. 3 x 10:20 = 90 minutes. if you’re using 10:10 you can cover 4.5 concepts before you need to take a break.
Target exercises at each key point. 1 point = 1 exercises. Later exercises can combine multiple points.
Provide scaling difficulty options for various levels of capabilities. Make sure you let people know what the minimum level of completion is. Have extra exercises for people who are fast. Challenging exercises should be hard, but not impossible. Don’t bother with answer files. People cheat.
Reduce cross-chapter reliance. People don’t like having to flip. If you want to rely on previously learned information, provide sample code so that they don’t need to remember what was previously covered.
New topic = clean slate = new chapter.
Your course notes should be comprehensive. Write a book, do not simply give a print out of your slide deck. Great documentation is a great advertising for you and your course.
Keep your room cold and fresh (21-23C). You may not be able to control this, but if you can: do so. It will keep your students more alert.
Leave the slowest behind in class. Offer them extra help during breaks and after the class. If you slow down for them; they will slow down even more.</p>
