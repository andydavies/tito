title: Process Model Method 
---

In this mini-series I’ve been talking about different ways to think about problems. The methods come from Edward DeBono’s book, Teaching Thinking. This method is the final one in the series.

The process model method direct attention to some basic process as distinct from areas. First you must set up the model for the process and then you must apply the model (e.g. analyze vs. compare). The compare process directs attention to features which two situations have in common and also to the features which differ. The analyze process directs attention away from the total situation and towards the component features.

To help learners use this framework we need to identify:

- how the items within a group are alike (“compare”)
- the individual components of an item, regardless of how it fits into the greater context (“analyze”)

The process model method is useful to a series of items and how it relates to others and to itself.

This was the final method outlined in Teaching Thinking. While doing related reading for this series, I stumbled across Graeme’s blog. He is a Master Trainer of de Bono Thinking: Education. If you enjoyed reading about these methods, you will probably also find Graeme’s blog an interesting read. http://newmillenniumthinking.blogspot.ca/
