            <h1>Does That Make Sense? Prove It.</h1>

<p>Have you ever stood at the front of the room waiting for confirmation that a concept made sense and you get blank stares (or bobbing heads back)? You have to trust that the information somehow got in there and will be usable by the student later. Don’t ever trust. Always make your students prove the information went in, by making them bring it back out again. Instead of asking, “does that make sense?” ask your students to, “sketch their answer”. I prefer giving out index cards (3″x5″ file cards). This way they don’t have to feel nervous about putting a wrong answer in their workbook. If they like the card, they can keep it. If they don’t, they can toss it in the recycle bin on their way out.</p>

<p>Participants: personal, seated activity</p>

<p>Materials: index cards or scrap paper torn into quarters (smaller pieces of paper are less intimidating).</p>

<p>Activity: instead of calling on a single student to answer a question, have everyone answer the question on an index card. After a brief period of time (1-2 minutes), ask if anyone would like to share their answer. I like asking for drawings as well as written answers. I especially like asking for the opposite mode of whatever I’ve given. e.g. if I used words, ask them to think of a shape or draw an animal that represents the concept (add words to explain the connection). It forces the student beyond straight memory when they have to think of the attributes of the question and represent them in a different way.</p>

<p>Anticipated outcome: If the students can not formulate the information by their own hand (through drawing or writing), they are more likely to realize they don’t know the answer and ask for clarifying information. Then, when you’re drawing on the class to read out their answers, you can affirm what the right answer is, allowing others to correct their own written answer if necessary.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <h1>Ready to Learn</h1>

<p>In my public workshops I find that some students come ready to learn and no matter what I do, they’re going to use the time to figure stuff out. Other people are paying for a completely different experience: they are looking to pay their way out of confusion and fear. In the second case my job is to create the conditions that will empower a person to take chances and try things out.</p>

<p>It’s easiest to learn when you have hooks into the new information which relate to something you already know. Learning a new skill is about taking the baby steps from where you are, to where you need to be. But what if you don’t even know where you are? Towards the beginning of every workshop I like to give participants a chance to hook into something they already know. If it’s a private workshop, I have the luxury of having the group talk about their own site and their experience with it. If it’s a public workshop, it’s a lot more difficult to find that common ground people can hook into.</p>

<p>In public workshops, I can give the group an exercise that everyone can complete at the same time. This gives the group a shared experience, but it isn’t as good as hooking into something they already know. I find the best workshops are when people bring their work problems with them to the workshop. We can use real examples, and the participants can ask real questions and get real answers about the situation. But often people are shy about “exposing” their work…sometimes it’s too political (they don’t like the design; some other department “made them” do something; etc), and some times people are just plain nervous about sharing their work.</p>

<p>The people who are ready to learn know where they are, and they tend to also have a clear goal of what “done” looks like. They know the skills gap they have to fill. “I am here; I need to be there.” If you don’t know where you are, it’s impossible to start because nothing looks like a beginning. I’ve tried a number of different ways to engage new learners who are nervous / afraid / angry to engage in defining their “beginning”…but when I think about the techniques I’ve used, none stick out as having been super effective at transitioning a person from skeptical participant to eager, and engaged, learner.</p>

<p>Some of the ones that gave only mediocre results:</p>

<ul>
<li>pre-class evaluation or test (very difficult to get people to complete these).</li>
<li>begin the class with a discussion of goals / problems that people are having (people don’t want to open up to strangers at the beginning of class)</li>
<li>write down your goals on an index card and pass them forward (people aren’t used to writing goals, so they don’t know what to write)</li>
</ul>

<p>What about you? Have you had success (and/or unexpected failures) at getting people in the right frame of mind to learn?</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <h1>Apple Boxing Method</h1>

<p>In this mini-series I’ve been talking about different ways to think about problems. The methods come from Edward DeBono’s book, Teaching Thinking. So far we’ve covered the North-South method and the Birdwatching method.</p>

<p>Next up is the Apple Sorting Method. With this method we create arbitrary categories to ensure the items are properly examined. Through careful examination we will see other traits and characteristics. The categories themselves are arbitrary. Our real objective is actually careful examination.</p>

<p>For example: my dad has an apple orchard. He uses the apples to make apple wine. Before taking the apples to the press he needs them sorted according to size (“large” and “small”). My niece sits down with a pile of apples and examines each one carefully before putting it into the “large” or “small” pile. While making the piles she finds a number of apples are wormy or have other buggy defects. She puts these apples into a third pile. When she finishes she calls my dad over. Delighted with her sorting, he dumps all the apples into a single large bin and takes them off to be pressed into juice.</p>

<p>What was the point of the piles!?the piles are arbitrary, but force careful examination of each object</p>

<p>If dad had asked the “bad” apples to be rejected, some would have been overlooked, and others (which were perfectly fine) might have been thrown out. By using a secondary classification system (size), he is able to get a nuanced rejection of apples that were “just bad enough” to be neither big nor small.</p>

<p>To help learners use this framework we need to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>arbitrary classification systems which complement / enforce careful examination (“big” vs. “small”)</li>
<li>features that will be intentionally observed as part of the classification (size of the apple relative to the others in the pile)</li>
<li>features that are not part of the classification system, but are key to evaluating this type of object (quality of the apple)</li>
</ul>

<p>The apple sorting method is useful to obtain a careful examination of items. I use the apple sorting method when I ask learners to classify Drupal modules according to the Drupal configuration pillars. Most modules fit into multiple categories, so the learner is forced to examine the module’s traits carefully (thereby learning more about the module) before assigning a category.</p>

<p>This technique is also quite similar to an technique used for for decision making called PMI. Draw up three columns on a sheet of paper and assign the headings: Plus, Minus and Interesting. In the first column write down all the positive results of taking action. In the second column, all of the negative things. In the third column write down the possible outcomes that are neither positive or negative. The column with the most items should help you to decide if you should take the action or not.</p>
