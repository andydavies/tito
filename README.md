# Training in the Open

This web site serves as a collection of ideas which need to
be captured, and perhaps which should be shared, about writing
and delivering exceptional technical training.

It was created, and is maintained, by Emma Jane Westby. You are welcome and encouraged to contribute.

The site is published at www.trainingintheopen.com.
