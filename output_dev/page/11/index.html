            <h2><a href="/blog/1969/12/31/_posts/workshop-planning/instructor_guide.md">Integrity of the Experience</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <h1>Integrity of the Experience</h1>

<p>For the last four years I’ve been poking in and out of the training world from various angles. I’ve updated curriculum, created my own curriculum, taught workshops by other people, and taken workshops. I love to see how other people structure their content, what resources are given to trainers, and where trainers are expected to invent their own experience is of particular interest to me.</p>

<p>At last week’s workshop Bob made an interesting observation: his trainers tend to be creative thinkers who may review the curriculum guides a few times, but generally have enough practice creating experiences that they don’t need the fine grained detail provided in a typical facilitator guide. In the technical training world, my experience has been with a different kind of trainer. In my “world” the trainer craves as much material as possible. Some will even copy by hand the facilitator guide to internalize the information so they can present it naturally during the class.</p>

<p>As I prepare to open source my own workshop, I have to think about how others will be delivering the content. I have a classroom structure that I know works for me. I know it’s repeatable (and doesn’t depend on my personality, or personal stories and anecdotes). But I need to decide: if the structure is different, is it still the same workshop? Should other instructors be forced to present the workshop my way to use the name of the course? (There are merits for both sides of the argument.)</p>

<p>One of the strongest arguments for a standardized classroom experience is when a standardized test is going to be given to the students. You want to make sure all of the content is covered in a way that students are neither given advantage or disadvantage in passing the test. On the flip side, different people will have different experience with the material (both students and instructors), allowing a customization allows us to personally connect with the materials and go “off track” to gain a richer understanding of the relevance to our own workplace.</p>

<p>A curriculum piece should eventually have a community of practice. It shouldn’t be a static document that lives in isolation of the classroom experience. But communities take time to nurture and maintain. My curriculum will probably be more descriptive than prescriptive. In other words: this is what works for me vs. this is how you must teach the workshop.</p>

<p>As an instructor, how do you prefer to receive a piece of curriculum? As an instructional designer, how do you maintain the integrity of the experience you’ve designed?</p>

            <h1>Linking Training and Organizational Objectives</h1>

<p>When I talk to new clients about training, the person I’m talking to is typically not a subject matter expert. They just know that their staff need training on a grocery list of topics. Then I start spouting off about objectives and outcomes and the person I’m talking to gets flustered.</p>

<p>As the trainer and subject matter expert I have to be able to tell the client what a reasonable set of outcomes is for their staff. In other words, I need to be able to say to the client: it’s reasonable for a project manager to be able to X, but a developer should be able to Y. Working together, this should result in your company being able to deliver Z to your client.</p>

<p>My content manager training for communication teams is very popular. This is what it looks like to me:</p>

<p>1/2 Day Workshop for Business &amp; Communications Teams — Intro to Drupal Content Administration 
By the end of this half day session, participants will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>locate and successfully use the add/edit screens for content displayed throughout the site (Drupal terms: blocks and nodes)</li>
<li>successfully add items to menus and dynamic lists of content (Drupal terms: menus and views)</li>
<li>trouble shoot content pasted from rich text sources, such as MS Word</li>
</ul>

<p>During the course of the workshop, the participants will create a collaborative “vacation manual” with instructions on how to update their site. This session will be conducted in English, the source files for the manual will be the property of the client.</p>

<p>But what the client wants to hear is:</p>

<p>By the end of this training the content managers will stop bugging the IT team with support tickets and they will understand how to do things in the site. Ideally they will stop complaining about Drupal and be able to just do their job. The trainer will be able to deal with random questions from students in a professional way and will always give the right answer according to best practices. In the workshop we will cover content editing, fixing the crappy output from WYSIWYG editors, and adding videos to the site.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to reconcile how to make sure the participants get the outcomes the business needs them to have, but without using scary language (and forcing managers to think/speak in testable outcomes). I’ve got a few strategies, but I’d love to hear how you deal with this too.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>Limits of Mind Maps</h1>

<p>I’ve spent the last few posts gushing about mind maps. I love them, and I’m not going to stop using them….however, now that I’ve got you hooked on them too I feel it’s only fair to tell you about some of the limitations of using mind maps.</p>

<p>When using mind maps for your presentations, be aware of their greatest strength: providing a overview of many topics. They are difficult to use for “deep dive” presentations. (Not impossible! But it’s easier to use them to create an overview.)</p>

<p>Olivia does a great job of explaining when you should, and should not use mind maps for your presentations. The tips she highlights are equally valid for lecturers in the classroom. But it also made me a little bit defensive of my lovely mind maps and got me thinking about how else mind maps could be used in the classroom. Here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage students to use mind maps to take notes (fewer words required; focuses on key terms and their relationships).</li>
<li>Challenge students to create a mind map of related concepts and defend (to the class) the connections they’ve made between topics.</li>
<li>Use a mind map as your hand out (the diagram itself).</li>
<li>Use a mind map to draft your hand out headings (as I discussed in a previous blog post).</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you used mind maps in your classroom effectively? (Or can you think of new ways that you want to try incorporating them into your teaching?)</p>
