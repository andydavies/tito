            <h1>Have Consequences by Showing Context</h1>

<p>A number of years ago I purchased a copy of The Cognitive Style of Powerpoint by Edward Tufte. I was flipping through it today while getting ready for the DrupalCon speaker training I’m giving and found a passage that I’d like to share.</p>

<p>A useful paper size for handouts at presentations is 11 by 17 inches, folded in half to make 4 pages. This piece of paper can show images and up to 60,000 characters of words and numbers, the content-equivalent of 50 to 250 typical powerpoint slides and text and data. Thoughtfully planned handouts at your talk tell the audience that you are serious and precise; that you seek to leave traces and have consequences. And that you respect your audience.</p>

<p>My lesson plans and presentations are always drafted on a sheet of US Letter paper, folded into quarters. Each quarter represents a unit of time (1/4 day for full day workshops; 15 minutes for hour-long presentations). My single sheet typically gets reformatted into an agenda for the attendees…but it gives very little information what they’ll actually be learning…not to mention it’s entirely UNinspiring for note taking.</p>

<p>Using an 11×17 sheet of paper almost seems like a luxury. I’ve immediately started thinking about how this single sheet of paper could give so much more context than what I can do in 2 sheets of US Letter paper. Here are a few of the benefits I can see:</p>

<p>Requires a special printer, preventing me from making tweaks right up to the last minute (and thus forcing me to practice the delivery of the presentation).
Folded once you have the equivalent of four sheets to work with. Folded twice you have a very portable reference booklet of 8 pages.
On one full side of the sheet you could give a “map” of the main software screen with lines leading off to each of the major tasks you were going to learn. (Think of a diagram of a watershed or some other ecology diagram.)
You could design the page in a way that actually inspired people to add notes by leaving little boxes and empty prompts.
Do you already use non-traditional information aids? What do they look like?</p>

            <h1>Wearing Your Blinders</h1>

<p>Last Friday I was doing some offline work at a coffee shop. I wanted to write up a quick list of online tools that I’ve either tried, or used, or heard good things about from other people. Very quickly I ran out of space on the page. I started cramming things in sideways. A couple of days later I added even more tools than are listed here.</p>

<p>When I stopped writing there were more than 60 tools on the list (and now there are even more). That’s a lot of tools. Many productivity hackers will enjoy the thrill of finding and evaluating a new tool. But what if you just want to get on with your job (or your life)? Or what if you’re just getting started? How would you tackle such a long list without getting overwhelmed, giving up, and going back to what was old and familiar?</p>

<p>In the horse world, to minimize distraction, horses are equipped with blinders (sometimes called “blinkers” or “winkers”) to shield the horse from seeing the whole scope of what’s happening around it. When dealing with the overwhelm of technology you can benefit from putting on your own set of blinders. And when learning a new topic you can definitely benefit from the same.</p>

<p>When you’re new: everything seems relevant and important. It’s hard to distinguish. As you become more comfortable with a system it becomes easier to identify what you need. The key steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify your primary goal or task.</li>
<li>Scan the list of possibilities with the intention of grouping items by topic or function. Identify common themes.</li>
<li>Using the common themes to group related items.</li>
<li>Using a rating scale of 1-3, identify a group of functions is (1) related a lot; (2) not sure; (3) definitely NOT related.</li>
<li>Discard all the groups or topics ranked 2 or 3.</li>
<li>Review your primary goal or task.</li>
<li>Using a rating scale of 1-3, identify within a group which individual items are (1) related a lot; (2) not sure; (3) definitely NOT related.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you’ve got a starting place.</p>

<p>If it seems simplistic, it’s because it is.</p>

<p>Let’s pretend you needed to share course notes with your students and you were going to use “an online tool” (i.e. something listed in the notebook).</p>

<ol>
<li>Primary goal: share notes with students.</li>
<li>Common themes listed in the notebook: travel, social networking, video distribution, meetings, billing/bookkeeping, mailing lists/group notification, content management.</li>
<li>Items by group: Travel (tripit, kayak, expedia); Mass notification (MailChimp, Aweber, Constant Contact, StatusNet, Yammer); Content management (Flickr, Picasa, Drupal, WordPress, LiveBinder, Notebook, Google Docs, Evernote); etc…</li>
<li>Group ratings: travel = 3 (not related); mass notification = 2 (maybe? seems interesting to tell students…); Content management = 1 (definitely related); etc.</li>
<li>Reject all things that are only maybe related: travel and mass notifications are now gone.</li>
<li>What am I doing? I want to share my notes with students.</li>
<li>Share notes with students. Flickr and Picasa are for photo sharing = 2. Drupal is for building data systems = 2. WordPress is for blogging = 2. (etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll end up with a lot of “maybes” in the final step. Discard the maybes! If you’re left with nothing after discarding the maybes, go back to the list and look for maybes that should have really been “irrelevant”. Start to get really picky and you’ll probably find that some “maybes” were actually “irrelevant” and others were actually “related a lot”.</p>

<p>When you really focus on your goal and continue to narrow down the list of options, eventually you’ll get to a single (or small subset of items) that you can really start to evaluate.</p>

<p>This activity differs hugely from starting with a grocery list of tasks or functions. Start with your one true goal and then simplify your list of options. Maybe you’ll skip over something that you should have evaluated. oh well. By having a focus, and then narrowing your options based on that focus you should also be able to quickly evaluate a very few options against your most wanted outcome.</p>

<p>TMTOWTDI (there’s more than one way to do it). Give your self a break. Put the blinders on. And get on with whatever it was you needed to do.</p>

            <h1>Wrapping Curriculum Around Existing Resources</h1>

<p>There are a lot of excellent Drupal resources available on the Internet. Videos, books, blog posts. Some are free, some are paid. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I think it makes sense to shape curriculum pieces around this content. A few of my favourite free initiatives that are ripe for curriculum wrappers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skills compass - http://skillcompass.org/learning-resources</li>
<li>Drupal 7 Essentials - http://drupal.org/node/1576418</li>
<li>Examples for Developers - http://drupal.org/project/examples</li>
<li>Learn Drupal - http://learndrupal.org/</li>
</ul>

<p>Book-wise, I’d start with my own titles (of course): Drupal User’s Guide and Front End Drupal. For module development I’d add Drupal 7 Module Development (http://www.packtpub.com/drupal-7-module-development/book) and possibly the Definitive Guide…although the size and breadth of the print book actually makes it more difficult for me to deal with. Print books are often heavily discounted by Amazon (sometimes even more than what a bookstore discount would be) and can be ordered in bulk for each class. Shipping a bunch of books to your workshop location is often a lot more convenient than dealing with photocopying and shipping student guides. And yes, you should be buying each student their own copy of the book. As an instructor you are probably being paid several hundred dollars per student for the class. After the Amazon discount, a book probably will cost you $20-30. Spend the money: your students are worth it.</p>

<p>So what does a curriculum wrapper look like? I think it should include at least the following:</p>

<p>Detailed agenda covering the training period in 10-20 minute increments.
Instructor guide with complete script for the day include necessary materials for any activities (e.g. white board + markers) and lab configuration information.
Student agenda with page references or URLs for each of the exercises they’ll be completing during the day.
Slide deck and other classroom/instructor aids (e.g. posters for the room).
As you deliver more and more training sessions you may find yourself deviating further and further away from a book. Where it makes sense: evolve your curriculum and add improvements that make sense for your teaching style. Perhaps you’ll even get to the point where you feel it makes sense to write your own materials from scratch.</p>

<p>It may sound naive to suggest you can simply bash someone else’s work into a reasonable piece of curriculum. It probably comes from spending too much time with SCORM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model). But I do think we swing too far the other way as well: assuming that all curriculum pieces need to be created entirely from scratch with our own secret sauce.</p>

<p>If you were going to teach a workshop (or take a workshop), which bit of existing material would you love to see incorporated into a class?</p>
