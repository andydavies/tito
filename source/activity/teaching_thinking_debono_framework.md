# Framework Method

In this mini-series I’ve been talking about different ways to think about problems. The methods come from Edward DeBono’s book, Teaching Thinking.

In the Framework Method you must set up and use a checklist of attention areas. Each attention area (or box) is filled in turn from the situation. For example: we establish a framework with five components:each step of the framework has its own "box" of attention

1. Purpose. Aim or objective
2. Input. Scene or ingredients
3. Solutions. Suggestions for solving the problem
4. Choice. Choose from the solutions (step 3)
5. Operations. Actions by which the solution is implemented

Each of the different steps within the framework may also have sub-steps. The best known framework method is probably the scientific method. (I might be showing my education bias here as I was trained as an environmental scientist.)

To help learners use this framework we need to identify:

- situations the evaluator must progress through a series of repeatable steps (as opposed to a sequence that the object of investigation is passing through)
- major steps that the evaluator must always complete, and sub-steps which may differ, or only be relevant in certain situations

The framework method is useful to establish a procedure to help you make decisions in a systematic, and consistent, way. I use a framework when evaluating which Drupal modules to install. I share this checklist with learners and encourage them to adapt it based on their values. (For example: I rank my relationship with the developer very high; but someone who is new to the Drupal community, who does not yet know many people, will need to use other measures in their evaluation.)
