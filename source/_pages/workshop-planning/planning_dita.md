The [Darwin Information Typing
Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) (DITA) is an XML model for authoring and publishing. When building curriculum, I love working with DITA to sort information into three basic categories:

- **Concepts** definitions, rules, and guidelines for things
  you ought to know, but aren't necessarily actionable.
- **Tasks** step-by-step instructions for things you can do.
- **Reference** detailed, factual information which doesn't
  need to be memorized, but might come in handy later on. For
  example: command syntax.

As I collect information I want to share with students, I sort
it into these three categories. Ideally each topic, will have a
little bit in each of these three categories.

If there is a topic which has a concept, but not a practical task, I will often re-think if I'm approaching the information correctly as
it's difficult to memorize information without seeing how I
would apply the concepts without the task instructions. ... and
it applies the other way around as well: if I don't know *why*
I'm doing something, it is difficult to remember how to
complete a task.
