            <h1>Using Mind Maps to Plan Curriculum Topics</h1>

<p>This week I had a private training engagement. The course was a half day webinar on Drupal for project managers. We had some key topics that needed to be covered during the workshop, but not an overall structure to place the information into.</p>

<p>I started with the free software package xmind and created a free-form mind map (http://www.xmind.net/m/gmu8/) with the topics I wanted to cover. The mind map format was a wonderful way to collect relevant topics. I didn’t like adding extra details to it (e.g. links, images, or learning objectives). I felt it got too cluttered with the extra details (and I did want the extra details).</p>

<p>My next step was to get the information out f a mind map and into something I could use for a presentation. At first I started copying things manually into a slide deck tool, OpenOffice Impress (although technically I use Libre Office Impress on my primary computer). It felt like a let down after the context that the mind map had provided me. I threw out the slides and continued to think about how I could extract information for my presentation aids.</p>

<p>While I was thinking about what presentation aids I wanted, I realized I could easily linearize the mind map and create a script for the class. xmind will export to rich text format, but only as a paid feature (I hadn’t purchased the software yet); included in the free version is the ability to save the mind map as a Freemind file, which can then be exported to OpenOffice. With all of the headings in place, I simply had to write the text for each topic. It was the fastest 23 page handout I’ve ever made!</p>

<p>I decided to present from the mind map instead of using slides. I did purchase the pro version of xmind to get the presenter mode, but I ended up wimping out and just using the handout as my guide. Not perfect, but the handout was above and beyond what I thought I’d be giving the students, and I was much happier that they have a longer term resources than pretty slides that were meaningless within a few weeks.</p>

<p>After wrapping up the presentation, I did go back to the xmind mind map and play around with the formatting a bit. The summary view (“spreadsheet”) http://www.xmind.net/share/emmajane/drupal-for-project-managers-1/ and the logic map (http://www.xmind.net/share/emmajane/drupal-for-project-managers/) are two different and interesting ways of formatting a mind map.</p>

<p>I’ve already started using xmind for a new curriculum project that I’m working on (PHP for CMS Developers). I have a feeling I’ll continue to bounce around the new tools while I find which tool best matches valuable outcomes for what tasks.</p>

<p>Do you have favourite planning tools that you use when designing your workshops?</p>

            <h1>Putting Video in Order</h1>

<p>This week I’ve been plugging away at a contract to make videos for my Drupal User’s Guide. I’ve had a linear outline for ages, but something wasn’t clicking. Everything was based on concepts and there was no real “hook” into the information. Using a structure I’d come up with for another class this spring, I pulled out my trusty lesson plan template (Click here to download the Lesson Planning Template) and started to restructure the content. It only took a little bit of shuffling to fix the narrative.</p>

<p>Then I took my revised outline and put it into a spreadsheet. The columns include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lesson title</li>
<li>Topic and sub-topic</li>
<li>Content notes (sub-sub-topics)</li>
<li>Delivery notes (concept, procedure, process or principle; slide or procedural screencast)</li>
<li>Name of the file <em>to</em> record (i.e. my TODO column)</li>
<li>Name of the file if already recorded</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t normally use spreadsheets to organize myself into actionable items but the TODO column is pretty awesome. (Those of you who use spreadsheets already know this.) Suddenly something that’s been an albatross to get going on seems exciting again.</p>

<p>Do you have any sure-fire planning aids you turn to when you’re stuck?</p>

        </header>

            <h1>Planning is Hard</h1>

<p>Right now I’m waiting to hear back from a couple of clients about their respective training contracts with me. I’ve  given both the homework of prioritizing what their staff need to learn based on the “typical” things they do at work. (Train for typical tasks where you want to affect behaviour; provide empowerment to learn on-the-job along with really awesome manuals for infrequent tasks.) And then, as is typical of this scenario, I get radio silence.</p>

<p>Doing job-task analysis (JTA) and planning for training is hard. It forces you to think about how your staff are “failing” at their job. It forces you to think about the things that your staff don’t know….in a domain of knowledge that you might not even know. I know it’s hard because the books I’ve read on creating in-house training programs gloss over the JTA part of learning design. In my experience any topic that’s glossed over is either really easy, or so complex that it’s easier to simply back away and leave it unexplained.</p>

<p>In the spring I gave the following survey to the trainees for an in-house program.</p>

<ol>
<li>On a scale of “1 to Hero” where do you rate yourself on the doing-my-job scale? (Hopefully this is a positive number.) Keep the rating within your job skills. For example: if you’re a project manager don’t rate yourself against what a developer is expected to do.</li>
<li>What information is preventing you from being Hero-rated? (You may answer “everything” if that’s how you’re feeling.)</li>
<li>What tasks do you work on day-to-day right now?</li>
<li>If you got some training, what else would you be doing?</li>
<li>What (lack of) skills are preventing you from doing the best possible job?</li>
<li>What resources have you already accessed that you’ve found helpful?</li>
<li>What’s information is missing from the resources you’ve been using so far?</li>
<li>What else should I know about you? About your current skills/background?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers I got back were surprising. It uncovered more about the anxiety on the job of failing to live up to the company’s expectations than it did specific topics. (I blame the “hero” question for setting the tone.) What I didn’t find surprising was that the people who’d been identified for the training program didn’t know what they didn’t know. Questions number 2 and 5 were surprisingly vague.</p>

<p>As I dug deeper into the culture of the company it became apparent that they had allowed too much autonomy to each team for the level of experience of their employees. One of the recommendations that I made was to pick a “recommended toolkit” that I could train against. This toolkit would need a specific set of Drupal modules that staff could be expected to use on a typical project. They wouldn’t be required to use it, but at least they’d have a starting place. Dare I say: the staff were suffering from Cartesian Anxiety.</p>

<p>So now I’ve started rolling ideas around in my head on how to simplify the learning planning process. How do you figure out what’s missing when your learners (and managers) don’t even know what’s possible? I’m not sure if this will be a set of questions, or a template of some kind, but I’m definitely missing something when I ask the question, “What do you need to learn?”</p>
