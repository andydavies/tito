# About Training in the Open

Hi! My name is Emma Jane. I am an author and trainer who delivers exceptional technical training and curriculum products. I have written, or tech edited, a half dozen books about Drupal, developed curriculum for Ubuntu, and [delivered over 100 presentations](http://emmajane.net/events) on topics ranging from data migration and version control to SEO and content marketing.  

My latest book, Drupal User’s Guide, was released September 2011. My digital workbooks, available through the Design to Theme Web site, are revered for their get-to-the-point, no-nonsense approach to Drupal skills development.
