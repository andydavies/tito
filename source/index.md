<h1>Training in the Open</h1>

Hi! My name is Emma Jane. I am an author, trainer, and developer who creates and delivers exceptional technical training and curriculum products. I have [delivered over 100 presentations](http://emmajane.net/events) on topics ranging from PHP, data migration and version control to SEO and content marketing; written three books, and contributed to several more as a contributing author, or tech editor; and created and recorded four video learning products.

My latest book, [Git for Teams](http://gitforteams.com/), was released September 2015 by [O'Reilly](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-4470479-11290546?sid=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.oreilly.com%2Fproduct%2F0636920034520.do%3Fcmp%3Daf-prog-books-videos-product_cj_auwidget670_0636920034520_%25zp).

I would love to help you create your own learning experiences for others, and I hope this site offers a few resources to get you going.
