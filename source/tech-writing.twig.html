<p>Eventually I'd like to expand this section to include resources on how to pitch and write your very first book. For now, just a couple of resources on writing good instructions.</p>

{% for sections,pages in data.pages_section %}
{% if sections == "technical writing" %}
<ul>
{% for page in pages %}
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor%} 
</ul>
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
