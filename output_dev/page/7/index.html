        </header>
        <div>
            <h1>Bird Watching Method</h1>

<p>The next method DeBono describes is the birdwatching method. These method allows us to spot patterns and phenomenons. When using this method we can also frame our observations so that they are merely a different way of being right or wrong. For example: when a learner looks at a situation they may use an entirely different classification system to the one we’d imagined. This tells us something about how they are observing the situation. It doesn’t mean their classification is “wrong”, it simply means they are using different categories than the ones we’ve identified.</p>

<p>Birdwatching method allows you to identify common traits so you can "see" patterns and the generic form of the pattern.For example: You’ve spotted a bird. You classify the bird as being a type of duck, but on further examination, the bird is actually a swan. Does that mean you were wrong? Not really. It just means you’ve identified your bird using the higher order classification of Anatidae, which includes swans, geese and ducks.</p>

<p>To help learners use this framework we need to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>the desired destination for the classification (swans vs. ducks; not black vs. white)</li>
<li>common traits or patterns that can be used for classification (neck length relative to head size; not colour)</li>
<li>traits and patterns that are unique within a classification (bird colour can change; body shape must be consistent within a group)</li>
</ul>

<p>The birdwatching method is useful when we need to judge and classify. Can you think of places where you could establish a simple birdwatching method for your learners? (The obvious one that comes to mind in teaching Drupal: is how to evaluate a new module before installing it; design patterns in software design; or perhaps when debugging code.)</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <h1>Framework Method</h1>

<p>In this mini-series I’ve been talking about different ways to think about problems. The methods come from Edward DeBono’s book, Teaching Thinking.</p>

<p>In the Framework Method you must set up and use a checklist of attention areas. Each attention area (or box) is filled in turn from the situation. For example: we establish a framework with five components:each step of the framework has its own "box" of attention</p>

<ol>
<li>Purpose. Aim or objective</li>
<li>Input. Scene or ingredients</li>
<li>Solutions. Suggestions for solving the problem</li>
<li>Choice. Choose from the solutions (step 3)</li>
<li>Operations. Actions by which the solution is implemented</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of the different steps within the framework may also have sub-steps. The best known framework method is probably the scientific method. (I might be showing my education bias here as I was trained as an environmental scientist.)</p>

<p>To help learners use this framework we need to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>situations the evaluator must progress through a series of repeatable steps (as opposed to a sequence that the object of investigation is passing through)</li>
<li>major steps that the evaluator must always complete, and sub-steps which may differ, or only be relevant in certain situations</li>
</ul>

<p>The framework method is useful to establish a procedure to help you make decisions in a systematic, and consistent, way. I use a framework when evaluating which Drupal modules to install. I share this checklist with learners and encourage them to adapt it based on their values. (For example: I rank my relationship with the developer very high; but someone who is new to the Drupal community, who does not yet know many people, will need to use other measures in their evaluation.)</p>

            <h1>Isolation Method</h1>

<p>In this mini-series I’ve been talking about different ways to think about problems. The methods come from Edward DeBono’s book, Teaching Thinking.</p>

<p>Next up is the Isolation Method. With this method we isolate certain obvious and automatic areas so they will get more attention. This method is especially useful at the “start” of thinking. Our goal is to hold the attention on something that is happening naturally, or to draw the attention back to something that was skipped.</p>

<p>The obvious example of this method is using a step-by-step mode in a software development tool. This mode allows the programmer to step through their code as if examining a movie frame-by-frame.break a sequenced progression into its component parts for careful examination</p>

<p>To help learners use this framework we need to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>situations where items are sequenced</li>
<li>ways to stop the progression mid-sequence</li>
</ul>

<p>The isolation method is useful when you need to figure out how one thing transforms into another through a defined process.</p>
