            <h1>Non-Linear Presenation Aids</h1>

<p>When I was in the UK a few weeks ago, I spent a bit of time working with Lorna to try and get her toolkit working for slides (it’s LaTeX, we wanted to change the fonts). I started thinking about my own slide decks and how I always found them lacking an ability to engage people. Fancy transitions don’t suddenly help a learner to see the context of how information fits together. Indeed, when I lectured at college ages ago, I avoided using slide decks and focused more on short lecture or demo + hands-on practice.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people use a few alternatives to linear slides (with positive effect). Instead of using a linear sequencing of “pages”, the document base used in the presentation adds context and movement between objects. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>xmind examples: http://xmind.net/</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog post about the presentation mode - http://www.xmind.net/blog/en/tag/presentation/</li>
<li>Video demonstrating presentation mode (it’s very similar to prezi, but less fussy, IMO) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ev3wuoGjzc</li>
</ul>

<p>Prezi examples: http://prezi.com/</p>

<ul>
<li>LinkedIn as a Business Growth Tool - http://prezi.com/qilhbxt-xry3/how-to-setup-linkedin-as-a-business-user/</li>
<li>Typography — this one has immediate inspiration to me for my Drupal theming presentations - http://prezi.com/ufnrer-swszq/typography/</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t have enough practice using either of these tools yet to want to completely make the switch away from slide decks, but I’ve definitely started to incorporate them into my planning + development process. In my next blog post I’ll tell you about how I used mind mapping to plan a recent workshop.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <h1>Recording Workshops</h1>

<p>When I first started teaching Web tech at community colleges (more than a decade ago) we recorded our practice teaching sessions. I never seemed to find the time to go back and review the video though. Today, whenever I can, I record my training sessions and provide the video to the students for review. It only adds a little bit of extra time to set up. Rendering the video can generally be done as a background process (even though it takes forever), making an overall addition of 1-2 hours of time per day of training. I know my students appreciate the safety net of being able to go back and review the materials. It gives them the freedom to let some topics “go”, knowing they can review the video later if they need to. Even if I could carve out the time to go back and review my own videos, I wonder if I’d know how to perform a useful critique of my own work. I definitely know how to be hard on myself…but being critical is hardly the same as receive a genuinely useful critique.</p>

<p>Do you ever review your own video recorded teaching? What criteria do you use to constructively evaluate yourself? How do you track progress? (Do you even track progress at all?) I’d love to hear more about your personal rubric…be it formal or “merely” a mental note to self.</p>

            <h1>The Role of the Trainer</h1>

<p>Sunday night I had an interesting conversation with a couple of other Drupal trainers about the role of the curriculum vs. the role of the trainer in very short training sessions (less than one day of contact). The hardest part of training is the discovery and development phase. By the time you get to the front of the room, all of your thinking should be done.</p>

<p>When software is constantly changing, it is very difficult (and expensive) to put together curriculum that is predictably right. This means we tend to put subject matter experts (SME) at the front of the room. They can deal with the pesky questions about edge cases and generally they can spot a typo in the exercises and think on-the-spot about how to fix any problems with the curriculum being a little out of date. Developing good curriculum is expensive; but it is also expensive to have a SME delivering content, instead of working on the improvements to the software that are needed to reduce the reliance on training in the first place.</p>

<p>Over the years of developing classroom experiences, I’ve come to truly appreciate that my “job” is to engage the learners so that they are motivated to practice what happened in the classroom outside of the classroom walls. It’s not sufficient for an instructor to live demo a technique and expect students to be able to repeat the procedure outside of the classroom walls. On days when I do provide demo-based training, I always make sure to record the session so that the learners can review the material later.</p>

<p>The shortest of conference presentations is an edutainment experience. The best I expect to be able to do is make the audience remember me as a personality and where to go next for more information about the topic we’re covering. In these cases having downloadable resources is very important. The presentation should walk the audience through the resources so that they know what to look for when they have time to come back to the content.</p>

<p>The longer the presentation / training session, the more important those reference materials become. If we think about the experience of an entire conference (multiple days), the reference material is just as important as a day-long workshop.</p>
