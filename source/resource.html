Notes about resources I have learned from--typically books. The notes are unlikely to be directly useful to you, but they should help you to decide if you want to invest in buying the title.

<ul>
{% for resource in data.resources %}
<li>
  <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ resource.url }}">{{ resource.title }}</a> 
  {% if resource.author %}by {{ resource.author }}{% endif %}
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
