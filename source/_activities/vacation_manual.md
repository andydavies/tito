title: Creating a Vacation Manual 
---

As a trainer I’m always working with organizations to ensure that the money they spend on me is actually money well invested in their staff. Structured training courses are just one part of this. There’s been more than one training course where my real value has been getting the staff away from their desks, away from their email, away from the constant demands on their time and allowed them to work together to solve a problem.

My facilitated “vacation manual” workshop is a great example of this. It’s very little “teaching” on my part, but it’s a fantastic activity for communication teams to really wrap their head around what happens on their web site and what they’re responsible for.

the role of the Enterprise Learning Community Manager and what
we can gain from getting away from course ware. Great stuff!
