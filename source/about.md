# About Training in the Open

Hi! My name is Emma Jane. I am an author and trainer who delivers exceptional technical training and curriculum products. My latest book, Drupal Userâ€™s Guide, was released September 2011. My digital workbooks, available through the Design to Theme Web site, are revered for their get-to-the-point, no-nonsense approach to Drupal skills development. 

Even though I am a Drupal advocate and trainer, this site is (currently) assembled as a Sculpin site. As my focus expands to adult education, I want to have the experience of working with a new platform. I want to remember what it is like to experience the unfamiliar.
